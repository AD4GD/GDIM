## AD4GD pilot vocabularies

The sources of truth for these vocabularies are hosted in the individual
pilot semantic repositories:

- [Pilot 1](https://github.com/AD4GD/pilot-1-water-quality-semantics/)
- [Pilot 2](https://github.com/AD4GD/pilot-2-ebv/)
- [Pilot 3](https://github.com/AD4GD/pilot-3-air-quality)

There is a [GitHub workflow](../.github/workflows/update-ad4gd-pilot-vocabs.yaml) that 
automatically downloads the vocabulary files from each of the repositories, so
**any changes done here will be overriden**.
